		<h1>Build Your Design Challenge</h1>
		
		<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
			<p>I enjoyed looking at and using <a href="http://simonfosterdesign.com/home/" target="_blank">Simon Foster's website</a> that showcases his work. <a href="http://www.beatboxacademy.ca" target="_blank">Beat Box Academy</a> have what I think to be a fun yet serious website.</p>

		<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>
			<p>Both websites use negative space to their advantage. Simon Foster places his name on the top left of the screen, in a large, sans seriffed and bold font, balancing it with the navigation bar on the top right which is listed in a smaller, lighter and seriffed font. As a western reader my eye naturally falls to the top left of a page and my experience with websites has taught me to look to the top right for navigation. These words are the only ones on page, the rest are images which creates a lovely sense of simplicity. It should also be noted that each image box has enough negative space to induce a feeling of calm, simplicity and even though these boxes take up the entire webpage and surround each other, the use of negative space and clean design allows the user to let their eye travel around the page at it's own pace.</p>

			<p>Beat Box Academy also use negative space to their advantage. Whilst I think the concept and the UX is excellent and possibly the main focus of this website, it is still well designed. They are using simplicity to their advantage. The main point of interest is the centre of the screen which they have communicated by creating negative space around the images and placing the navigation bar at the top left of the page. The descending navigation bar is relatively small and simple, allowing the central image to highlight this page. The page is nicely balanced with a focus on the centre, the left nagivation could create a sense of unbalance but by using reoccuring and muted colours in combination with a small bar, the sense of symmetry and balance is relatively uninterrupted. As you scroll down the nav bar stays unmoving, yet the text boxes and images swap between left to right giving a nice divide between each section of imagery and information whilst still maintaining a sense of balance.</p>

		<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>
			<p>A big difference would be the location of the navigation bar. Simon Forster places his horizontally in the top right of the page, whereas Beat Box Academy locates theirs vertically on the top left of the page. Theirs also stays stationary whilst moving through each page with the font matching the titles to create a sense of design unity. Beat Box Academy have essentially the same structure reoccuring throughout moving through the pages, and this along with a stricter colour palette creates a sense of uniformity between the pages. From a design perspective the use of colour is very different upon comparing the two pages. Simon Foster uses bright, strong colours amongst muted grey, whilst Beat Box Academy sticks to tones within a smaller colour palette. An interesting quirk used by Beat Box is the incorporation of using the keyboard. You are encouraged to press keys to interact with the home page and you use the arrow buttons to scroll. This is very individual and I would consider it to be somewhat outdated, as it doesn't translate to touchscreen devices.</p>
			
			<p>Generally both websites take a somewhat minimalist approach to design. The use of negative space is carefully considered and the amount of options in terms of where to navigate to is kept to a minimum. Both don't have a drop down menu when hovering/clicking an option on the naivagtion menu.</p>
